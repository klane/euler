Euler
=====

Euler contains a Java framework for solving [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems in Java, Python, and R.
Python scripts are run using [Jep](https://github.com/mrj0/jep/) and R scripts using
[rJava](https://github.com/lucarosellini/rJava-maven/). This project was inspired by Colin Decker's
[project-euler](https://github.com/cgdecker/project-euler/).
